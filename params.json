{"name":"WIN - WC INFO","tagline":"","body":"### WIN - Wc INfo\r\nHow many times did you have to go to the toilet and once there you found the sign \"out of service\"? Or even an endless queue and you donâ€™t know that a little further on there is a nearly empty toilet?\r\nOur goal is to help you so this will not happen again!\r\nWith WIN you will be able to check in real time if the toilet you are looking for is in service or not and it will also let you know the current or average waiting time in queue for the toilet and how many people are there. It will also show you if there are other toilets nearby where there's no people waiting in queue, so you can choose the best one for you.\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\nWe are Computer engineering students enrolled on the [Ambient Intelligence] @AmI-2015 course at [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it).\r\n\r\nSimon Mezzomo @simlt, Luca Vacchetta @LucaVacchetta, Vittorio Vaselli @vasellivittorio), and Thomas Vitale @ThomasVitale","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
