# WIN (Wc INfo)

How many times did you go to the toilet and once there you found out it was out of service? How long did you wait to enter because of an endless queue and you did not know that a little further on there was a nearly empty toilet?

Our goal is to help you so that this will not happen again!

With WIN you will be able to:
- check in real time wether the toilet you are going to is in service or not;
- know the current or average waiting time in queue for the toilet and how many people are there;
- know if there are other toilets nearby where there are no people waiting in queue, so you can choose the best one for you.
